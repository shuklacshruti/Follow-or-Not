# Follow-or-Not: A Social Follower Comparison Tool

Follow-Or-Not is a simple tool that helps you compare your Instagram followers and following lists. By uploading two files—your "following" list and "followers" list—the tool will generate a list of accounts you're following that do not follow you back.

How It Works: 
- Export your followers and following data from Instagram. Instructions below.
- Upload the files (.txt, .html, or .pdf) to the tool.
- The tool will compare the two lists and output the accounts that are not following you back.

Features: 
- Accepts multiple file formats (.txt, .html, .pdf).
- Uses PDF.js for PDF processing.
- Simple, user-friendly interface.
- No data is stored or shared—processing happens locally in your browser.

Requirements: 
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc) :)
- Internet connection.

How to Run the Project: 
- Clone or download the repository from GitHub
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Follow-or-Not.git
